# README Firmware for STM32LVGL

MicroPython LVGL for STM32

The firmware are files that result from the build of "micropython_lv". Although several output files are generated, the most useful is the "firmware.hex" file. One can load their STM32, by utilizing the STM32CubeProgrammer (or similar software) to flash a firmware.hex file.
